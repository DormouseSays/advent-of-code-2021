# Advent of Code 2021
Advent of Code solutions in JavaScript for 2021.

Code is split up by day with input, tests, and functions to run each individual challenge or both together. All days are imported through a main file based on the way [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) imports models.

run all days with `npm start` or a specific day by number, ex `npm start 3` to run day 3.

## Testing
`npm test` will run all tests, or you can run a specfic file ex:`npm test -- day/01/day01.test.js`
